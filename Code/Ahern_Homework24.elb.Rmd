I CAN SEE THAT YOU WORKED THROUGH THE CODE. HOWEVER, YOU HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR CODE THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU ARE DOING PARTICULAR STEPS, SO I CAN'T TELL THAT YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT THROUGH THE MATERIAL. 


set things up
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

suck in data / look at it
```{r}
lady<-read.csv(here("Data","ladybirds.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
glimpse(lady)
```

```{r}
totals<-lady%>%
  group_by(Habitat,colour)%>%
  summarise(total.number = sum(number))
```

```{r}
ggplot(totals,aes(x=Habitat,y=total.number,fill=colour))+geom_bar(stat='identity',position='dodge')+scale_fill_manual(values=c(black="black",red="red"))
```

```{r}
lady.mat<-xtabs(number~Habitat+colour,data=lady)
lady.mat
```

```{r}
lady.chi<-chisq.test(lady.mat)
names(lady.chi)
lady.chi$expected
lady.chi
```

```{r}
ozone<-read.csv(here("Data","ozone.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
glimpse(ozone)
```

```{r}
ggplot(ozone,aes(x=Ozone))+geom_histogram(binwidth=10)+facet_wrap(~Garden.location,ncol=1)+theme_bw()
```

```{r}
t.test(Ozone~Garden.location,data=ozone)
```

```{r}
var.test(Ozone~Garden.location,data=ozone)
```
